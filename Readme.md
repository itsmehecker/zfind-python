## zfind for all platforms 
The Idea came into the mind when I worked for cargo-cult

This is an implementation that works in the same idea but this time it also works on windows 

# How it works
well both zsh and bash all support storingh history in .zsh_history or .bash_history file
(if you have time stamps enable this should ignore those )

for windows: - there is a file that stores it similar to zsh and bash but only for powershell
there is no option afaik

you'd open these files find snippets and give options

the selected option would be copied to clipboard 

** this is written in python for easier understanding of the code compared to rust where for the beginner developer or average user would fail to understand anything and also should provide an easier installation as python is installed in most linux based systems by default and is also very light weight  **

# Features 
- easy to use
- good looking TUI
- copy commands to clipboard
- maybe synching to cloud?? XD

# Installation
clone git
venv?
install dependencies
build
add to path


** written in love with Python**
